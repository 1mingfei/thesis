\section{Introduction}
\label{Transport Intro}
For reference, some common equations and brief overviews of the three categories of particles will be given in this chapter. The Maxwell equations \eqref{Gauss}--\!\,\eqref{Ampere}, the continuity equation for charge density and current density \eqref{continuity}, the Lorentz force equation \eqref{Lorentz}, Newton's second law of motion \eqref{Newton2}, and the \ac{MHD} approximation of Ohm's Law \eqref{Ohm} are each useful for basic plasma physics. Thorough derivations for these and related equations can be found in several textbooks, including \citet{gombosi98} and \citet{jackson99}.

\begin{subequations}
 \begin{align}
  \nabla\cdot\mathbf{E}&=\frac{\rho_e}{\epsilon_0}&\quad\text{Gauss's Law}
  \label{Gauss}\\
  \nabla\times\mathbf{E}&=-\frac{\partial\mathbf{B}}{\partial t}&\quad\text{Faraday's law of induction}
  \label{Faraday}\\
  \nabla\cdot\mathbf{B}&=0&\quad\text{Gauss's law for magnetism}
  \label{Gauss m}\\
  \nabla\times\mathbf{B}&=\mu_0\mathbf{J}+\mu_0\epsilon_0\frac{\partial\mathbf{E}}{\partial t}&\quad\text{Amp\`{e}re's law}
  \label{Ampere}
 \end{align}
\end{subequations}
\begin{align}
 \nabla\cdot\mathbf{J}&=-\frac{\partial\rho_e}{\partial t}&\quad\text{continuity equation}
 \label{continuity}\\
 \mathbf{F}&=q\left(\mathbf{E}+\mathbf{v}\times\mathbf{B}\right)\quad\text{(N)}&\quad\text{Lorentz force}
 \label{Lorentz}\\
 \mathbf{F}&=m\mathbf{a}\quad\text{(N)}&\quad\text{Newton's 2nd law of motion}
 \label{Newton2}\\
 \mathbf{J}&=\sigma\left(\mathbf{E+v\times B}\right)\quad\text{(A m$^{-2}$)}&\quad\text{Ohm's law}
 \label{Ohm}
\end{align}

In these equations, $\epsilon_0$ is the electric constant (also called the permittivity of free space), $\mu_0$ is the magnetic constant (also called the permeability of free space), $\sigma$ is the electrical conductivity, treated here as a constant, $q$ is the charge, $\rho_e$ is the charge density, $m$ is the mass, $\mathbf{J}$ is the electric current density, and $\mathbf{E}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ are the electric and magnetic fields. $\mathbf{F}$, $\mathbf{v}$, and $\mathbf{a}$ represent force, velocity, and acceleration. 

In \ac{MHD}, the fields are induced by plasma motion, so the fields vary on the same time and length scales as the plasma variables. If high frequency variations in the electric field are not included, and only the non-relativistic regime is considered, the displacement current in Amp\`{e}re's law can be neglected, leading to Equation~\ref{AmpereMHD}.
\begin{align}
 \nabla\times\mathbf{B}&=\mu_0\mathbf{J}&&\quad\text{MHD Amp\`{e}re's law}
 \label{AmpereMHD}
\end{align}
\indent By substituting Equation~\ref{Faraday} and the curl of Equation~\ref{AmpereMHD} into the curl of Equation~\ref{Ohm}, $\mathbf{E}$ and $\mathbf{J}$ can be eliminated to derive the magnetic induction equation \eqref{MHDinduction}. The first term on the right describes the resistive diffusion of the magnetic field in the plasma while the second term describes the convection of the magnetic field by the plasma.
\begin{align}
 \frac{\partial\mathbf{B}}{\partial t}=\frac{1}{\sigma\mu_0}\nabla^2\mathbf{B}+\nabla\times\left(\mathbf{v}\times\mathbf{B}\right)&&\quad\text{magnetic induction equation}
 \label{MHDinduction}
\end{align}

Since Equation~\ref{Gauss m} states that the divergence of the magnetic field vector $\mathbf{B}$ is zero, $\mathbf{B}$ can be written in terms of a vector potential $\mathbf{A}$:
\begin{align}
 \mathbf{B}=\nabla\times\mathbf{A}\quad\text{(T)}.
 \label{B field}
\end{align}

By substituting Equation~\ref{B field} into Equation~\ref{Faraday}, Faraday's law of induction can be written as a quantity with a vanishing curl. Such a quantity can be rewritten as the gradient of a scalar function, the scalar potential $\Phi$, leading to an equation for $\mathbf{E}$ in terms of the potentials $\mathbf{A}$ and $\Phi$:
\begin{align}
 \mathbf{E}=-\nabla\Phi-\frac{\partial\mathbf{A}}{\partial t}\quad\text{(V m$^{-1}$)}.
 \label{E field}
\end{align}

For electrostatics, all derivatives with respect to time are zero. In this case, the divergence of Equation~\ref{E field} combined with Equation~\ref{Gauss} will give the Poisson equation, or in the absence of charges, the Laplace equation:
\begin{align}
 \nabla^2\Phi &= -\frac{\rho_e}{\epsilon_0},&\quad\text{Poisson's equation}
 \label{Poisson}\\
 \nabla^2\Phi &= 0.&\quad\text{Laplace's equation}
 \label{Laplace}
\end{align}

Due to the historical precedent of the symbols used in these and other common equations, a symbol may have different meanings depending on the equation in which it is used (i.e., `E' can represent `electric field' or `energy'). Even though the meaning of the symbol can usually be discerned from the context of the equation, an attempt has been made to use distinct symbols throughout this dissertation, or use subscripts to clarify a symbol's meaning when necessary. In the specific case of `E', the bold font $\mathbf{E}$ is used to represent the electric field vector and $\left|\mathbf{E}\right|$  to represent the magnitude of the electric field. The plain font E is always used here to represent energy.

Particle transport and acceleration are important topics of research in heliophysics. An understanding of the composition and nature of the gas and plasma found in space is vital to the forecasting of space weather. This research focuses on ways to investigate three categories of particles: the solar wind (\S~\ref{Solar Wind}), pickup ions, and energetic particles, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:H_Distribution}. The following is intended to provide sufficient background for the scope of this dissertation research.

\section{The Solar Wind}
\label{Solar Wind}

\subsection{Current Knowledge}
\label{SW Current Knowledge}
While he was not the first to postulate its existence, the physics of the solar wind was first explained by Eugene Parker in 1958 \citep{parker58}. Beginning with subsonic speeds close to the Sun, plasma accelerates away from the solar surface and reaches supersonic speeds in the corona. It continues to expand in a radial direction outward until it interacts with the material in interstellar space at the edge of the heliosphere, the Sun's sphere of influence. The wind draws the solar magnetic field along with it, creating spiral-shaped field lines as the Sun rotates \citep{parker59}. Mankind's understanding of the processes that govern the solar wind has increased as spacecraft have taken in situ measurements, but there are still some properties that remain unexplained, such as the precise origin of certain types of wind, as discussed below.

The solar wind travels a distance of one \ac{AU} before reaching Earth's orbit, where most of the current measurements have been taken (Table~\ref{tab:solar wind}). It is generally divided into two components, commonly referred to as the ``fast'' and ``slow'' solar wind. Originally, these terms were used to differentiate the wind by the speed with which it traveled, but more recent studies have shown that the two types of wind are more efficiently distinguished by their charge state composition (e.g., O$^{7+}$/O$^{6+}$) since the plasma can change speeds as it flows through space \citep{geiss95b, gloeckler03a}. Rather than the terms ``fast'' and ``slow'', more appropriate labels are descriptive of the wind's origin: ``coronal hole'' and ``streamer'' wind. These two types of wind are generated by different processes and have different compositions, temperatures, speeds, and origins.

As solar wind ions escape from the photosphere and travel up through the corona, they experience collisions with energetic electrons that ionize them to different degrees. As they travel farther through the corona, continuously accelerating, the density of coronal electrons decreases and the particles experience fewer collisions. When the timescale for ionization or recombination becomes longer than the timescale of the solar wind to expand through a density scale height, the charge state of the ion is said to be ``frozen in,'' branding the ion with the coronal region and electron temperature of its origin \citep{hundhausen68}. The streamer wind has a distinct characteristic of being enriched in elements with a low ($\le$ 10 eV) \ac{FIP} by a factor of 3--4 over the photospheric value. The coronal hole wind does not show this density enhancement, and measurements have revealed abundances of low-\ac{FIP} elements that match ratios in the photosphere \citep{vonsteiger93}. The streamer wind also has a higher and more variable freeze-in temperature than the coronal hole wind. One explanation for this describes solar plasma trapped and heated in large coronal loops that are eventually opened by interchange reconnection, releasing the plasma \citep{gosling95, fisk98, fisk99a}.

The coronal hole wind originates in the open flux regions of the Sun, which contain low-density plasma and concentrations of magnetic flux that are all the same polarity. During solar minimum these regions are clustered around the poles of the Sun, while during solar maximum they appear at all latitudes. Plasma in open flux regions is also released from flux loops, but the high concentration of open flux increases the probability that the loops will open before they can heat and fractionate the plasma. The anti-correlation between freeze-in temperature and solar wind speed shown in Table~\ref{tab:solar wind} can be interpreted in a simplistic way as a sign of different sized loops. The long-lived loops that produce the streamer wind will expand and rise slowly into the corona, where the temperatures are hotter, before being opened \citep{fisk98, fisk01a}. The short-lived loops that yield the coronal hole wind are opened while they are still small and close to the cooler surface \citep{fisk99a, fisk03, wimmer03b}.
