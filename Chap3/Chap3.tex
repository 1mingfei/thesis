A significant challenge for applications of Mg alloys is their poor corrosion resistance and hence Mg alloys designs with built-in corrosion resistance are of significant interest. Corrosion can result from the coupling of anodic dissolution of Mg and cathodic reduction of water on impurities such as Iron (Fe)-rich second-phase particles. Experiments have shown that small quantities of Arsenic (As) or Germanium (Ge) can inhibit Mg corrosion, possibly slowing the \ac{HER} as the cathodic reaction on Fe surfaces. Since a broader experimental search across the periodic table for other Mg corrosion inhibiting elements is unavailable, we designed thermodynamic and \ac{HER} criteria, and used high-throughput computations to search a pool of 68 elements including As and Ge that can segregate from bulk Mg to surfaces of Fe particles and impede \ac{HER} there. Our computational procedure predicts that six p-block elements meet these criteria, and they rank according to their ability to reduce H adsorption energies and the \ac{HER} rate as follows: $\text{As} > \text{Ge} > \text{Si} > \text{Ga} > \text{P} \approx \text{Al}$. Results for As, the most effective corrosion-inhibiting element, and Ge are in qualitative accord with recent experiments. While none of the 68 elements was found to enhance H adsorption, the six p-block elements reduce H adsorption via strong orbital overlap (Pauli repulsion) between their outer-shell orbitals and the s orbitals of H adsorbates. These p-block elements are also found to have the potential to reduce \ac{HER} on surfaces of Ni second-phase particles in Mg according to the same criteria, but not on surfaces of Cu second-phase particles.
