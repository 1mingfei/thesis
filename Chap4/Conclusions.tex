\section{Conclusions}

Ag thin film quality (improve texture and reduce internal defects) can be improved by increasing ZnO substrate quality.

Pd, Sb, Se, Sn and Te can be good candidates as anchor sites on ZnO substrate.

With trace amount of anchor sites on the surface of substrate, more nuclei can be achieved, hence more continuous ultrathin film.
