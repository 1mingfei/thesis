Metal/oxide interfaces are among the most important heterogeneous structures because various thin films are present in optical coatings, semiconductor devices, and catalysts. Therefore it is important to understand the thin film stability and morphology evolution during deposition processes. From this study, we will understand: (1) What are the major factors that affect metal thin film morphology during the deposition? (2) How do we improve the wettability of metallic thin films on the oxide substrates?

To answer these two questions, \ac{GCMC} simulations are conducted on various substrates based on Ag-substrate bonding strength obtained from H-saturated ZnO (000$\overline{1}$) surfaces, with different lattice constants and substrate orientations. Among these parameters, substrate orientation is critical to Ag thin film quality. It turns out that the hexagonal substrate is robust for Ag thin film growth under different lattice constants and yields the best Ag thin film quality with \{111\} orientation because misfit dislocations are easier to generate hence helping interface stress released. 
%Besides, several polycrystalline substrate cases are also studied to consider a more realistic case.
By adding a trace amount of ``anchor'' sites on the substrate, thin-film morphology becomes much smoother and more continuous. Then high throughput \ac{DFT} calculations are used to identify potential ``anchor'' elements. Five elements, Pd, Sb, Se, Sn, and Te, are found to have the ability to act as ``anchor'' site elements that can increase Ag nucleation densities on substrates that have weak bonding to metallic thin films.
