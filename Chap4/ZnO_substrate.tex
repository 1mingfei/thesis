\section{ZnO Substrate Yields the Best Ag Thin Film}

In this section, we will investigate which substrate type is best for Ag thin film deposition. Three different bond length will be used: 3.3$\angstrom$, 2.9$\angstrom$, 2.3$\angstrom$. 3.3$\angstrom$ is equivalent to ZnO lattice constant. 2.9$\angstrom$ is for Ag bond length, which means this substrate has a zero misfit for Ag thin film. At last, 2.3$\angstrom$ is selected for simulating a negative lattice mismatch factor, where lattice mismatch factor($f_{mismatch}$) is defined via:
\begin{align}
    f_{mismatch} = \frac{a_{substrate} - a_{film}}{a_{substrate}}
    \label{Chap:Ag/ZnO:eq:mismatch}
\end{align}
