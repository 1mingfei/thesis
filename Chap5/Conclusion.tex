\section{Conclusion}
\label{Chap:Al/Vac:section:Conc}


In this chapter, Ag-Mg-Zn ternary alloy is used as a model system to simulate the solute clustering kinetics in Al 7000 series alloys. We first demonstrate that the \acf{BEP} relationship, which suggests a simple linear relation between the activation barrier and the reaction energy of one elementary reaction step, fails to provide quantitatively accurate migration barriers of vacancies in these multi-component Al alloys. Then we develop a \ac{NN} model to predict vacancy migration barriers using the training data set of thousands of \ac{DFT} calculated barriers for different alloy configurations. 

A \ac{kMC} method based on this \ac{NN} model is used to study the early transition behavior from a supersaturated solid solution to solute clusters and \acf{GP} zones in Al-Mg-Zn alloys. A local super-basin method  Section \ref{Chap:Al/Vac:sec:LSKMC}, together with \ac{LRU} cache in Section \ref{Chap:Al/Vac:sec:LRU}, is also implemented to accelerate \ac{kMC} simulations. 

We also propose a pseudo-atoms approach to efficiently search the alloying strategy to slow down the solute clustering and the corresponding natural aging effects in Al 7000 series alloys. In this approach, a small number of pseudo-atoms with artificially designed ability to change vacancy migration barriers are added into the Al matrix, and the \ac{kMC} simulations are performed to check their effects to clustering kinetics (so-called ``sensitivity test''). 

We also develop quantitative analysis methods to describe the chemical and structural properties of clusters. Using these quantitative analysis methods, we find that, 1) during the early stage of clustering, Zn-rich clusters appear first, and these clusters become stable very soon, only after 3 seconds; 2) for early-stage clusters, Zn/Mg ratio is converged to 1.2, which is consistent with experimental observations; 3) one possible reason for slightly Zn-rich early-stage clusters is the migration barriers for the vacancy to jump to the adjacent Zn atom is lower than their counterparts for Mg or Al. 

At last, we propose a machine learning strategy based on the structural and chemical information of clusters and precipitates from \ac{kMC} simulations to predict the cluster strengthening and natural aging effects in future studies.
