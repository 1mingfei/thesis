Nucleation and growth theories of precipitates in solids are critical to guide the design of structural alloys because two fundamental principles need to be met: 1) high ductility during processing stages, 2) high strength during the serving stage. However, classical nucleation theories and traditional \ac{KMC} method based on \acf{BEP} relationship fail to provide quantitative guidance for the development of multi-component alloys because of the large number of element types. On the other hand, accurate on-the-fly \ac{KMC} simulations require costly \ac{NEB} calculations from \ac{DFT}, which is not affordable. In this study, we developed a method combining \ac{KMC} and \ac{NN} functions to study the early transition behavior from a supersaturated solid solution to \ac{GP} zone of Al 7000 series alloys. A \ac{NN} function is trained on several thousand \ac{NEB} calculations for diffusion barriers of random and ordered structures using \ac{DFT}. A local super-basin method together with \ac{LRU} cache, is also used to accelerate \ac{KMC} simulations.
