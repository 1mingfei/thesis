\section{Results and Discussion}
\label{Chap:Al/Vac:section:RD}

In this section, we will first discuss how to distinguish and visualize clusters from the matrix. Then our benchmark on key experimental value (Zn/Mg ratio, Al/(Mg+Zn) ratio) will be discussed. Nest, we will study how to change cluster size distributions and chemical compositions by adding a small number of pseudo-atoms. At last, the viability of using cluster geometry and chemical composition to predict strength given a certain cluster will be briefly addressed.


\subsection{Cluster Searching Algorithm}

In order to better analyzing our results, we have to use a visualization method to characterize clusters. A cluster is a set of connected atoms, each of which is within the range of one or more other atoms from the same cluster. Thus, any two atoms from the same cluster are connected by a continuous path consisting of steps fulfilling the selected neighboring criterion. Adversely, two atoms are not considered in the same cluster if there is no continuous path on the neighbor network leading from one particle to the other. We choose between the distance-based neighbor criterion, in which case two atoms are considered neighbors if they are within the neighbor list of each other. However, in our case, all the atoms are on lattice, so the method described above does not work. It will simply find one huge cluster containing all the atoms. Therefore, we use the method described in Algorithm. \ref{algo:cluster}. We show one typical results in Fig. \ref{Chap:Al/Vac:fig:illu_cluster}. To better visualize details of clusters,  only top ten clusters are shown. 
%As you can see, dark red and orange clusters are almost connected. They share one Al atom in common. In that case we treat them as two clusters. Otherwise, if Al atoms are treated like bridges, then most of the atoms in the supercell will be connected as one huge cluster, which is not desired.

\subsection{Benchmark of Al-Mg-Zn Clusters}
\label{Chap:Al/Vac:benchmark}
For the \ac{KMC} simulations, (30x30x30) supercell containing 108,000 atoms were used. 3240 Mg atoms, 1700 Zn atoms, and 1 vacancy atom were randomly chosen among 108,000 atoms. This setup corresponds to $\sim$ 3 atom. \% of Mg, $\sim$ 2 atom. \% of Zn and a vacancy concentration of $\sim$ 1e-6. We used \ac{LSKMC} algorithm to boost the simulation. After around $\sim$5.5 seconds of simulation, clusters size and the ratio of Mg/Zn converged to a local minimum of a very initial stage of the multiple-stage clustering process. As shown in Fig. \ref{Chap:Al/Vac:fig:Al_Mg_Zn_benchmark} (a), the size of Al-Mg-Zn clusters are converging to a $\sim$2400 atoms size using Algorithm. \ref{algo:cluster} with $size_{critical}$ of 3 and $bond_{critical}$ of 3. If tighter criteria($size_{critical}$ of 3 and $bond_{critical}$ of 3) were used, then much fewer atoms can be identified as forming clusters and number of atoms in clusters converges to a much smaller value of $\sim$ 1000. Even though the tighter criteria offset cluster sizes by almost 1000. Both two setups follow the same trend and converge after several seconds.

And in Fig. \ref{Chap:Al/Vac:fig:Al_Mg_Zn_benchmark} (b), we plotted the ratio of Zn/Mg within identified clusters. Also, two different criteria were tested. When bonding criteria ($bond_{critical}$) was set to 4, very little Al atoms will be counted as clusters, resulting in a very low Al/(Mg+Zn) ratio. This is too artificial, therefore we did not plot it here. Again, both setups trend similarly for Zn/Mg ratio and converge around 1.25. This ratio of Zn-rich clusters is comparable to the early stage solute clusters reported in \cite{liu2020formation}. Atomistic pictures of those clusters can be found in Figure. \ref{Chap:Al/Vac:fig:sens_control}. In addition, the distribution of cluster sizes is provided in Figure. \ref{Chap:Al/Vac:fig:size_distr}. With cluster size frequencies, it become easier to identify how many clusters are stable.

\subsection{Searching for Potential Elements that Can Slow Down Early Stage Nucleation}
\label{Chap:Al/Vac:pseudo}
Similar to the idea of searching ``anchor'' elements in Chap. \ref{Chap:Ag/ZnO:section:anchor}, we will first use \ac{KMC} simulation with some pseudo-atoms (denoted as ``X'') to study their effects on the early stage clustering. In this study, we have Al atoms as solvent atoms, and Mg, Zn atoms as solute atoms. To tune the properties of pseudo atoms, we can change the effects of different elements on vacancy diffusion barriers to the pseudo-atoms, as well as barriers to other elements. We leverage this by adding an offset to the diffusion barrier calculated from \ac{NN} model via Equation. \ref{Chap:Al/Vac:eq:offset} . The amount of the offset is determined by counting first neighbor bonding of X-Al, X-Mg, and X-Zn, via Equation. \ref{Chap:Al/Vac:eq:offset_calculation}:
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
{E_a}^{actual} & = {E_a}^{NN} + \textit{offset} \label{Chap:Al/Vac:eq:offset} \\
\textit{offset} & = \sum_{i\in\{Al, Mg, Zn\}} \varepsilon_{i-X} * ( n_{i-X}^{final} - n_{i-X}^{init}) \label{Chap:Al/Vac:eq:offset_calculation}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
where ${E_a}^{NN}$ is the energy obtained by the neural network prediction of treating element ``X'' as the solvent element Al, the summation is confined to first nearest-neighbors of the vacancy and of the jumping atom, $\varepsilon_{i-X}$ represents the amount of different pairs' effects on the diffusion barrier offset, and $n_{i-X}$ is the number of first nearest neighbor $i-X$ pairs. For example, if $\varepsilon_{Al-X} = 0.01$ that means increasing an Al-X pair will increase the diffusion barrier by a positive 0.01 eV.


The right hand side of Equation. \ref{Chap:Al/Vac:eq:offset} can be divided into two parts. The first part, which is \ac{NN} potential part, can be seen as a more comprehensive bond counting model \cite{soisson1996monte} base on the pair interactions of Al-Al, Al-Mg, Al-Zn, and Mg-Zn, plus cross interactions or higher odered angular contributions. And the second part of the RHS is can be seen as first order bond counting of Al-X, Mg-X, and Zn-X. As a qualitative study, first order pair-wise interaction of the unknown pseudo-atoms should be sufficient. If we rearrange Equation. \ref{Chap:Al/Vac:eq:offset}, we will have:
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
{E_a}^{actual} & = \sum_{i, j \in\{Al, Mg, Zn, X\} \& i \neq j} \varepsilon_{i-j} * ( n_{i-j}^{final} - n_{i-j}^{init}) + \textit{H.O.T.(Al, Mg, Zn)} \label{Chap:Al/Vac:eq:rearrange}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
where $H.O.T$ is the higher order term, such as bond angles. Then the target is to find an element ``X'' that can change the diffusion barrier of Vac-i by roughly the amount of $\varepsilon_{i-X}$, where $i \in \{Al, Mg, Zn\}$.

To setup the simulation for sensitivity tests, we use \ac{LSKMC} method with $step_{critical}$ of 25,000 steps and $E_{critical}$ of 0.3 eV. After around 5 $\sim$ 6 seconds simulation, we can already tell the differences of cluster size obviously. As discussed above, we tuned parameters of $\varepsilon_{i-X}$ for $i \in {Al, Mg, Zn}$. Detailed setup is listed in Table. \ref{Chap:Al/Vac:tab:pseudo1}. And their corresponding final snapshots can be found in Fig. \ref{Chap:Al/Vac:fig:sens_Al}, Fig. \ref{Chap:Al/Vac:fig:sens_Mg}, and Fig. \ref{Chap:Al/Vac:fig:sens_Zn}, respectively. In order to achieve the target of finding a suitable element ``X'', we can use \ac{DFT} with \ac{NEB} to search for elements that can change the diffusion barrier of Vac-i by roughly the amount of $\varepsilon_{i-X}$, where $i \in \{Al, Mg, Zn\}$.

The atomistic structures of sensitivity test for control group, Al group, Mg group, and Zn group can be found in Figure. \ref{Chap:Al/Vac:fig:sens_control}, \ref{Chap:Al/Vac:fig:sens_Al}, \ref{Chap:Al/Vac:fig:sens_Mg}, and \ref{Chap:Al/Vac:fig:sens_Zn}. In order to better visualize the change of structures and stoichiometry, we plotted the cluster size changes and ratio between species in Figure. \ref{Chap:Al/Vac:fig:sens_cluster_size} and \ref{Chap:Al/Vac:fig:sens_cluster_ratio}. In Figure. \ref{Chap:Al/Vac:fig:sens_cluster_size}, cluster size change for Al, Mg, and Zn, with and without pseudo-atoms are plotted. With and without considering pseudo-atoms in the clusters does not change the trend significantly. The purple line represents the cluster size change of the control group. Configurations with pseudo-atom having  $\varepsilon_{Al-X} = -0.05$, $\varepsilon_{Zn-X} = 0.05$, and $\varepsilon_{Mg-X} = 0.05$ have the ability to make clusters to grow much larger after around 2 second.  From Table. \ref{Chap:Al/Vac:tab:pseudo1}, Al, Mg, and Zn species grow with respect to the similar ratio. However, their counterparts ($\varepsilon_{Al-X} = 0.05$, $\varepsilon_{Zn-X} = -0.05$, and $\varepsilon_{Mg-X} = -0.05$) cannot reduce the cluster size. Their curves behave similar to the control group.

To study the chemistry of solute clusters, we plotted the ratio of 1) solvent/solute atoms; 2) Zn/Mg in Figure. \ref{Chap:Al/Vac:fig:sens_cluster_ratio}. In Figure. \ref{Chap:Al/Vac:fig:sens_cluster_ratio} (a), the Al/(Mg+Zn+X) ratio in the clusters of those setups that growing larger dropped significantly. The reason might be two folds: 1) the pseudo-atoms (X) inside the cluster increases in these setups. 2) the shapes of those clusters tend to be more blocky like compared to the elongated structures. From Figure. \ref{Chap:Al/Vac:fig:sens_Mg}, and \ref{Chap:Al/Vac:fig:sens_Zn}, we can see there is obvious more X atoms within the identified clusters. Also, in Figure. \ref{Chap:Al/Vac:fig:sens_cluster_ratio} (b) we plotted the ratio of Al/(Mg+Zn). Without X atoms, the ratio only drops $\sim$0.1 instead of $\sim$0.2. Therefore, configurations with pseudo-atom having  $\varepsilon_{Al-X} = -0.05$, $\varepsilon_{Zn-X} = 0.05$, and $\varepsilon_{Mg-X} = 0.05$ tended to have more pseudo atoms segregate into the cluster side, and their cluster shape might tend to be more blocky (less Mg, Zn coordinates for neighbor Al to be identified as within clusters).


In Figure. \ref{Chap:Al/Vac:fig:sens_cluster_ratio} (c), we compared different pseudo-atoms alloying effects on changing Zn/Mg ratio. Most of pseudo-atom setups did not change the ratio, and those configurations still form Zn-riched clusters with the ratio converging to a value of 1.2. However, more Zn-riched clusters or more Mg-riched clusters can be achieved by using $\varepsilon_{Zn-X} = 0.05$ and $\varepsilon_{Mg-X} = 0.05$. This provides the opportunity to tune cluster local chemistry, hence enhancing/weakening the APB energy barriers. In Figure. \ref{Chap:Al/Vac:fig:sens_bond}, detailed bonds information was summarized by plotting changes of different bond counts against time for the entire environment(including both matrix and clusters). Counts of Al-Mg, Al-Zn, Mg-Zn, Al-X, Mg-X, and X-Zn bonds were plotted, respectively.

The ultimate provision of this study is to study how clusters affect strengthening and how to manipulate it. To investigate the relationship between clusters and hardness, many theories have been developed recently. \cite{yasi2010first, starink2009thermodynamics, curtin2006predictive} From a microscopic view, the hardening happens by impeding dislocation moving. The effect of clusters on changing hardness can come from two sources: 1) the long-range effect, which is the strain effect. 2) the short-range effect, which depends on the local chemical bonding of clusters. 

For the long-range strain effect, each cluster provides only a small amount of resistance, but the very high density of clusters generates a high strain to impede the dislocation movement. Dislocations can cut through the precipitates/clusters and continue to move through the Al matrix. In addition, coherent precipitates also further impeding dislocations by generating a higher strain in the matrix lattice. This strain field will be a function of cluster size, cluster distribution as well as chemical distribution across the matrix.

For the short-range strain effect, when dislocations cut through an \textbf{ordered} solute clusters, only local bond changes will be observed. Additional energy is required to create an anti-phase boundary (APB). The work needs to be done for movements of dislocations hampered by clusters equals the change in energy-related to the short-range order per unit area of slip planes. Hence under quasi-equilibrium thermodynamics assumption, the energy differences between these initial and final structures might be responsible for the hardening effect. It is then critical to figure out how the short-range order of clusters will affect the hardness.

The simulation outputs in this section, such as chemical composition, cluster size distributions, and bond statistics will be the input parameters of the classical continuum model or machine learning surrogate model to predict the hardness change during natural aging. If we assume that the effects of trace solute elements and heat treatment procedures on natural aging hardening can be fully described by the structural, mechanical and energetics parameters generated in the above \ac{KMC} simulations. Then we can build similar surrogate models to predict the natural aging hardening effects under the influence of various types of solute elements.
