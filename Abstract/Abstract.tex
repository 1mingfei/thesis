Metallurgists have been making every effort to test and invent new desired alloys. As the requirements of the quality and combination of different properties of materials become higher, more costly and complicated processing techniques have to be used. Currently, to fulfill requirements of the quality and combination of different properties of materials, more costly and complicated processing techniques have to be used. However, for civilian-sector industrial-scale applications, cost and sustainability are also of vital importance.   ...............
