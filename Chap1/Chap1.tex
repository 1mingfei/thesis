Adsorption strengths of H on anion-terminated (000$\overline{1}$) surfaces of pure and doped wurtzite ZnO are investigated under varying H surface coverage conditions. Consistent with the prediction of the classical electron counting rules, a $\frac{1}{2}$ \ac{ML} of adsorbed H changes the electronic structure of pure ZnO (000$\overline{1}$) surface from metallic to semiconductor state by saturating unpaired electrons of surface oxygen atoms. This closed-shell electron configuration of ZnO (000$\overline{1}$) surface significantly reduces the adsorption strengths of subsequent H atoms, making the dissociative adsorption of a hydrogen molecule endothermic. A simple electron counting model is applied to predict and tune the coverage-dependent H adsorption strengths on general polar semiconductor surfaces. This model is confirmed by our investigations of H adsorption on (000$\overline{1}$) surfaces of ZnO with a series of dopant elements (Na, Mg, Al, Ti, Fe, Sn, etc.). It can also be applied to H adsorption on other similar polar semiconductors, such as ZnO (000$\bar{1}$) containing O vacancies, wurtzite GaN  (000$\overline{1}$), and zincblende ZnS ($\overline{1}$$\overline{1}$$\overline{1}$) surfaces.
