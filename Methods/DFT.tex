In order to investigate interactions between hydrogen atoms and free surfaces of metals or oxides, we need to study their electronic structures. On the other hand, an accurate diffusion barrier energy also relies on a accurate reaction pathway. These can be achieved by first-principles methods. The interactions of the positively charged nuclei and negatively charged electrons are considered to be a many-body problem. In principle, a quantum mechanical solution to this problem can be obtained by solving the Schr\"{o}vdingerâ€™s equation involving both nuclei and electrons. The time-independent, non-relativistic Schr\"{o}dinger equation for an N-electrons system can be written as,
