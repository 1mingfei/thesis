To investigate the electronic structure
The interactions of the positively charged nuclei and negatively charged electrons in a crystalline structure are considered to be a many-body problem. In principle, a quantum mechanical solution to this problem can be obtained by solving the Schr\"{o}vdingerâ€™s equation involving both nuclei and electrons. The time-independent, non-relativistic Schr\"{o}dinger equation for an N-electrons system can be written as,
