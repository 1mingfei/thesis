\section{Kinetic Monte Carlo Simulation}
\label{Chap:Mech:KMC}

Many real reactions will take a long time, for example, hours, to happen, so the reaction kinetics are difficult to observe by only using \ac{DFT} calculations or \ac{MD}. As discussed in section. \ref{Chap:Mech:GCMC:MC}, \ac{MC} method is used here to help solving stochastic time evolution in a much longer time scale. Much previous research used this method to simulate vacancy bulk diffusion, surface diffusion, and surface growth. \cite{frenkel2001understanding, leach2001molecular}

A typical \ac{KMC} method follows these procedures written below:

0. Start the simulation at time t = 0.

1. Build or update an event list for all the possible event i with rate $r_i$ in the system.

2. Calculate the cumulative function $R_i = \sum_{j=1}^i r_j$ for $i = 1,...,N$, where $N$ is the total number of events.

3. Generate two uniform random number $u, v \in (0, 1]$.

4. Choose the event $k$ based on $R_{k-1} < u < R_k$.

5. Carry out the event $k$.

6. Update the time with $t = t + \Delta t$, where $\Delta t$ is obtained via
\begin{align}
    \Delta t = - \frac{\log{v}}{R_N}
    \label{Chap:Meth:eq:KMC:1}
\end{align}

7. Goto step 1 again.

For a system of vacancy on-lattice diffusion in bulk materials, each event rate can be calculated from \ac{DFT} with \ac{NEB} method in principle. However, \ac{NEB} calculations are extremely time-consuming for simulating billions of steps for \ac{KMC}. And the relationship between diffusion barriers and energy differences are not linear for multi-component systems. Therefore, the \ac{NN} functional is trained based on \ac{DFT} calculations to predict diffusion barriers. Thus, we can build a multi-scale methodology, which combines \ac{DFT}, \ac{NN}, and \ac{KMC}, to study the thermodynamics and kinetics of the early nucleation stage of GP zone in Al alloys.
