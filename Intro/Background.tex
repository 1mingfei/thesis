\section{Background}

Humans in all times have never stop the discovery of innovative alloys. The application of alloying metals allows the metallurgist to customize the properties by combining various of properties of metals together and using the metals interactions to provide unique different alloys. Alloying basically provides the opportunity of inventing new materials where the desired properties are the target.

And the history of alloy processing is a history of mankind itself. Metallurgists have been making every efforts to test and invent new desired alloys. For example, thin film deposition manufacturing are essential for semiconductor industry, solar panels, and optical devices industries today. Basically, thin film deposition applies a very thin film of material of $\sim$ nanometers to $\sim$ micrometers onto a surface to be coated, or onto a previously deposited layer to form layers.
