\section{Background}

Humans in all times have never stop the discovery of innovative alloys. The application of alloying metals allows the metallurgist to customize the properties by combining various of properties of metals together and using the metals interactions to provide unique different alloys. Alloying basically provides the opportunity of inventing new materials where the desired properties are the target.

And the history of alloy processing is the history of mankind itself.
